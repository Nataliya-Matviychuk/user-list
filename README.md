# user-list

This project contains a simple user list application. The main entry point is the `index.html` file, which provides the structure and layout for displaying a list of users.
 The application uses basic HTML and CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. Users can be viewed in a list format. The `index.html` file includes a form for adding new users and a section for displaying the user list.

## Responsive Layout

The user-list application is designed with a responsive layout to ensure it looks great on devices of all sizes. The `index.html` file includes media queries in the CSS to adjust the layout based on the screen size. This ensures that the user list and form are easily accessible and usable on both desktop and mobile devices. The responsive design principles used in this project include flexible grids, fluid images, and CSS media queries to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
